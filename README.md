# Scrapezilla

Scrapezilla is a full stack web scraper app that scrapes https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/ for the latest posts. Then it allows the user to make and save notes on any of the posts that have been scraped. 

The app uses Node, Express server, Handlebars for view generation, MongoDB database, Mongoose ODM, and cheerio for web scraping. Full MVC design pattern was used in creating this full stack project. For the front end, Materialize was also used as the CSS framework.
